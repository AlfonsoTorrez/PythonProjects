# Temporal Image Processing

### Overview: 
Temporal Image Processing was one of my first Python projects. The purpose for this application is to remove any inconsistencies from a group of pictures and to create one master picture. For example: What if you took several pictures of a car, but while you were taking them someone was walking in front of the car. You can retake the pictures or you can save time and use my application to gather all the photos taken to create one image without the person in the photo. In my project file I have included some images so anyone can try out my application and see a working example. 
During the creation of the application I learned how to use the following technologies:

+ Python
+ Python Image Library
